--- Spherical Coordinate Grapher in C++ ---

Hey everyone — this is the pre-dev statement for my next project: building a spherical-coordinate grapher in C++.

The goal of this project is to take in points or functions defined in spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) and convert + render them in 3D. I’ll start with a simple point-plotter and grow it into a full interactive grapher that can visualize surfaces, 3D fields, and mathematical objects that are easier to express in spherical space.

Eventually, the project will support:

Converting spherical → Cartesian in real-time

Plotting 3D point clouds and surfaces

Rendering custom equations defined in spherical coordinates

Swappable render engines (Raylib / OpenGL)

Possibly animation + simulation modules later on
